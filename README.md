# CMan

CMan: short for Channel Manager.

# NOTE:

This work is (for now) a direct copy of https://github.com/go-tomb/tomb. I have typed over everyline (for learning purposes), and made some very small changes, but I don't consider this my work! I will probably remove this repo at some point. If's going to stay I will make it a fork. I will add back all comments, copyright notices etc. And put the original git history back in.
